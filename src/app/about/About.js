                  Performers add their name to a lineup. When it is their turn
                  to perform, they perform for viewers for a fixed amount of
                  time. Viewers watch the performance and provide feedback to
                  the performer.

                  icons. The reactions are applause, laugh, sad, angry, awkward,
                  confused, hearts, and shock. After the performance, viewers
                  vote on the performance by giving it a rating of money,
                  tomato, or meh.

                  service that is most likely to ensure authentic people behind
                  the login. We understood privacy concerns, and the only
                  information we request from Facebook is your name, e-mail, and
                  public profile picture.

                  nudity, violence, hate speech, etc. CurtnCall&trade; is
                  supposed to be fun, and we would like to keep it that way as
                  much as possible. We reserve the right to stop any performance
                  and ban any performer from CurtnCall&trade; that we feel does
                  not meet these rules.

                  If a viewer absolutely doesn't want to watch a performer
                  anymore, viewers have the option to pull the plug on the
                  performer. By clicking the pull the plug button, the viewer
                  will no longer have to watch that particular performance.
